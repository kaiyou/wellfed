# Wellfed

Wellfed ("Well federated") proposes a set of specifications and tools to
manage meta relationships between servers inside and across federations.

If provides a single format for servers in various federations to describe
their properties. This is to be used by clients in order to display meaningful
information to users, and by third party crawlers, in order to build statistics
or provide interactive server lists.

## Manifest specification

Most server developpers and server owners will simply want to comply with the
[Wellfed manifest specification](SPEC.md).


## Crawlers

Much work happening here.
